This is a patch to the current publicly-available version of GIZMO (http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html). It adds isotropic and anisotropic velocity-dependent (Yukawa-like potential) SIDM cross section as well as an evolving 3-component Baryon Disk Potential.

New Compilation time flags for the SIDM scattering are:

SIDM_ISOTROPIC <br/>
SIDM_ANISOTROPIC

These need to be set in addition to DM_SIDM

Installation: <br/>
Simply copy and replace these files in the main GIZMO directory.
