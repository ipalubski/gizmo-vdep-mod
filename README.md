This is a patch to the current publicly-available version of GIZMO (http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html). It adds isotropic and anisotropic velocity-dependent SIDM cross section as well as an evolving 3-component Baryon Disk Potential.

New Compilation Time Flags For the SIDM scattering are:
SIDM_ISOTROPIC
SIDM_ANISOTROPIC

These need to be set in addition to DM_SIDM
